"""A key pressed during a remap must not fire after the rebind.

The user remaps a hotkey: the menu captures the key (hotkeys suspended),
then rebinds. The key they just pressed is still physically down when
the poller comes back - and the poller, whose `_poll_down` table never
saw that key, treated it as a fresh press and fired the command the user
just reassigned (issue: remapping Divide to Num2 auto-executed the
action).

The fix: `_unregister()` resets `_poll_down`/`_poll_last`, so the next
tick re-baselines from the live key state - a held key is the baseline,
not an event.

Checked: with the key held across suspend+rebind, no command fires;
after it is released and pressed again, the command fires exactly once.
